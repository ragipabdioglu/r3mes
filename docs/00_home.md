# R3MES Documentation

Welcome to the official R3MES documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to understand, build with, and participate in the R3MES network.

## What is R3MES?

R3MES is a decentralized protocol that transforms idle GPU power into productive AI training. Instead of solving arbitrary puzzles, participants train real machine learning models and earn rewards for their contributions.

The protocol combines **Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)** consensus with distributed AI training, creating a network where computational resources directly advance artificial intelligence while maintaining blockchain security.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Execution Layer** | BitNet model training with LoRA adapters for 99.6% bandwidth efficiency |
| **Verification Layer** | Three-tier optimistic verification with trap jobs and CPU arbitration |
| **Coordination Layer** | Cosmos SDK blockchain for consensus, rewards, and governance |
| **Storage Layer** | IPFS-based decentralized storage for gradients and model weights |

## Why R3MES?

**For Miners**: Transform your GPU into a productive asset. Earn REMES tokens by training AI models instead of wasting energy on meaningless computations.

**For Stakers**: Secure the network and earn passive income. Delegate your tokens to validators and receive a share of network rewards.

**For Developers**: Build on a decentralized AI infrastructure. Access trained models, submit inference requests, and integrate AI capabilities into your applications.

**For Researchers**: Contribute to open AI development. Propose datasets, participate in model governance, and shape the future of decentralized machine learning.
